3. **Real-Time Feedback**: Get immediate responses to your explanations

**Practice Script:**
> "Claude, I want to practice Amazon security interviews. Please ask me technical questions about threat modeling, and I'll respond verbally. Give me feedback on my explanations and business impact focus."

### Option 2: Self-Recording System
**Equipment Needed:** Smartphone/webcam + screen recording software

**Setup:**
```bash
# Windows: Use built-in Game Bar for screen recording
Windows Key + G -> Start Recording

# Or use OBS Studio (free)

1. Read scenario from repository files
2. Record yourself explaining the solution (voice + screen)
3. Review recording for:
   - Clear communication
   - Business impact focus
   - Customer trust messaging
   - Technical accuracy

### Option 3: AI-Powered Mock Interview Platform

**Tools to Set Up Immediately:**

#### A. ChatGPT Voice Mode + Screen Share
```
1. Open ChatGPT on phone/computer
2. Enable voice mode
3. Share screen with technical scenarios
4. Practice real-time technical discussions
```

#### B. Otter.ai + Practice Sessions
```
1. Install Otter.ai (free transcription)
2. Record practice sessions
3. Get transcripts to analyze:
   - Did you use "I" vs "we"?
   - Did you include specific metrics?
   - Did you connect to customer trust?
```

## 🎤 Interactive Practice Framework

### 1. Technical Deep-Dive Practice (30 minutes)

**Setup Script for AI Assistant:**
```
"You are an Amazon security engineer interviewer. Ask me technical questions about:
- Threat modeling for 100M+ users
- Secure code review with live screen sharing
- AWS security automation with boto3
- Vulnerability analysis and business impact

For each answer:
1. Challenge my technical depth
2. Ask follow-up questions about scale
3. Push for business impact quantification
4. Test my customer trust focus

Be tough but fair - this is for a senior role at Amazon."
```

**Example Interaction Flow:**
- **AI**: "Walk me through threat modeling our customer authentication service handling 50M users."
- **You**: [Verbal response with screen sharing of threat model]
- **AI**: "How would this threat impact customer trust specifically?"
- **You**: [Business impact explanation]
- **AI**: "What if this happened during Prime Day traffic?"

### 2. Behavioral Interview Practice (20 minutes)

**STAR Story Practice Script:**
```
"Practice Amazon Leadership Principles with me. I'll name a principle, you tell a story using STAR method. I'll interrupt with follow-up questions like a real Amazon interviewer.

Focus on:
- Security-specific examples
- Customer impact
- Specific metrics and data
- Personal accountability
- Learning and growth

Start with Customer Obsession."
```

### 3. Live Coding Practice (15 minutes)

**Screen Share Coding Setup:**
1. Open VS Code or your preferred IDE
2. Have AWS CLI configured
3. Practice writing boto3 scripts live while explaining

**Practice Prompts:**
- "Write a script to audit S3 bucket permissions across all regions"
- "Create a Lambda function for automatic security group monitoring"
- "Build a vulnerability scanning orchestration system"
