## Customer Impact Assessment Framework

### Impact Categories

#### 1. Direct Customer Data Exposure
**Definition**: Customer personal, financial, or sensitive data accessed by unauthorized parties

**Quantification Methods**:
- **Per-Record Cost**: Industry average $165 per exposed customer record
- **Total Exposure**: Number of affected customers × per-record cost
- **Recovery Time**: 12-18 months average for customer trust restoration
- **Churn Impact**: 5-15% customer loss typical after major breaches

**Example Calculation**:
```
Threat: SQL Injection in customer profile system
Affected Records: 2 million customers
Direct Cost: 2M × $165 = $330M potential liability
Churn Impact: 10% × 2M customers = 200K lost customers
Revenue Impact: 200K × $120 annual value = $24M annual recurring loss
Total Impact: $330M + $24M = $354M first-year impact
```

#### 2. Service Availability Disruption
**Definition**: Customers unable to access services due to security incidents or controls

**Quantification Methods**:
- **Hourly Revenue Loss**: Based on customer transaction volume
- **Customer Satisfaction Impact**: NPS score reduction per hour of outage
- **Support Cost Increase**: Additional support tickets and staff time
- **Competitive Impact**: Customers switching to competitors during outage

**Example Calculation**:
```
Threat: DDoS attack on Prime Video streaming
Affected Customers: 50 million active streamers
Hourly Revenue: $2.3M (based on subscription + advertising)
Outage Duration: 4 hours
Direct Revenue Loss: 4 × $2.3M = $9.2M
Customer Compensation: 50M × $0.50 service credit = $25M
Total Impact: $34.2M for 4-hour outage
```

#### 3. Customer Trust Erosion
**Definition**: Long-term damage to customer relationships and brand reputation

**Measurement Metrics**:
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: Typical 10-20 point drop after security incidents
- **Customer Acquisition Cost**: 25-40% increase due to reputation damage
- **Media Coverage Impact**: Negative sentiment analysis and reach
- **Competitive Positioning**: Market share loss to "more secure" competitors

**Example Assessment**:
```
Threat: Payment data breach affecting credit card information
Trust Impact: NPS drops from 45 to 25 (-20 points)
Acquisition Impact: CAC increases from $50 to $70 (+40%)
Recovery Timeline: 18-24 months for full trust restoration
Competitor Advantage: 15% of prospects cite "better security" when choosing rivals
