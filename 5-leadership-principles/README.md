# Leadership Principles - 50% of Amazon Interview

## Critical Importance
- **Every interviewer** tests 2-3 Leadership Principles
- **50% of interview score** based on behavioral responses
- **Bar raisers** specifically evaluate cultural fit through LPs

- **Task**: Your personal responsibility (use "I" not "we")
- **Action**: Concrete steps you took
- **Result**: Measurable outcomes with data/numbers

## Recruiting Team Guidance
> "Data in your answers is absolutely critical. If you can use a number in your example/story, use it."
> "Make clear the impact of your actions."
> "Articulate technical decisions but also business impact."
> "Everything is based on what you tell us, so structure is critical."
